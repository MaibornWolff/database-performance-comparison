# Database performance comparison for IoT use cases

MaibornWolff does a lot of IoT projects. One important part of IoT projects is storage and analysis of device data/events. To get some reliable numbers to help us choose well suited databases for specific use cases, we have started to compare some horizontally scalable databases in regards to how well they handle typical IoT workloads and tasks. We are doing this test for us but maybe it's of interest to other people as well. This repository contains the results and the tooling for this comparison.

Currently we have two types of tests: Rapid and concurrent inserts to simulate data ingestion of device events (to keep it simple we simulate temperature events) as well as some queries that are typical in IoT projects. More query tests are planned but not yet implemented. For the inserts we are doing batch inserts as we assume that we ingest them from Kafka and not directly from a MQTT broker.

The initial idea was to see how the scalable SQL databases YugabyteDB and CockroachDB perform in those use cases as we wanted to see to which extend we could use such SQL databases in IoT projects but since we were already at it we threw in ArangoDB in the mix and then added Cassandra and InfluxDB. We might add more databases like Elasticsearch/Opensearch or TimescaleDB later. Keep in mind that that we are comparing apples and oranges here (non-timeseries DBs with timeseries DBs) so you have to interpret what the results mean for you yourself :-) Also real-life performance might look different since we do not test mixed workloads and we also do not try things like upgrading the database cluster during the tests to simulate real-life events like it. The tests are meant to give a first impression / assessment.

**This is a work-in-progress and is neither intended nor designed as a complete or standardized benchmark like TPC.**

This readme contains three sections:

1. The test results
2. How can the tests be replicated / how to use the test tooling
3. Short note on how you can make changes to the tests

## Benchmark

Using the test setup from this repository we ran tests against PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, ArangoDB, Cassandra and InfluxDB with (aside from PostgreSQL and InfluxDB) 3 nodes and 16 parallel workers that insert data (more concurrent workers might speed up the process but we didn't test that as this test was only to establish a baseline). All tests were done on a k3s cluster consisting of 8 m5ad.2xlarge (8vCPU, 32GB memory) and 3 i3.8xlarge (32vCPU, 244GB memory) EC2 instances on AWS. The database pods were run on the i3 instances with a resource limit of 8 cores and 10 GB memory per node, the client pods of the benchmark on the m5ad instances. In the text below all mentions of nodes refer to database nodes (pods) and not VMs or kubernetes nodes.
For Azure Data Explorer the test setup was adapted to the following: AKS with Standard_D8_v5 on 3 Nodes.

All tests were run on an empty database.

### Benchmark procedure

Upon execution the helm chart found in `deployment/` is installed on the cluster. By default we execute 3 runs and average out the results to compensate for fluctuations in performance. A run consists of the workers and one collector instance being spawned in individual pods inside the same k3s cluster. Due to node selectors workers could not run on the same nodes as DB instances to avoid interference.
Each worker generates and writes the configured amount of events into the database. Event schemata and API usage are found in `simulator/modules/{database_name}.py` (note: for cockroachdb and yugabytedb we use the postgres module), event generation logic may be reviewed under `simulator/modules/event_generator.py`.
After each run the workers report statistics to the collector instance. The database is wiped inbetween separate runs to have a reproducible baseline.

For generating primary keys for the events we have two modes: Calculating it on the client side based on some of the fields that from a functional perspective guarantee uniqueness, or having the database increment a `SERIAL` primary key field. The exception here is Cassandra as using serial primary keys for rows opposes the main concepts of Cassandra we omitted this step and always relied on a db-generated unique partition key (device_id, timestamp).

For the insert testcase we use single inserts (for PostgreSQL with autocommit) to simulate an ingest where each message needs to be persisted as soon as possible so no batching of messages is possible. Depending on the architecture and implementation buffering and batching of messages is possible. To see what effect this has on the performance we have implemented a batch mode for the test.
For ArangoDB batch mode is implemented using the document batch API (`/_api/document`), the older generic batch API (`/_api/batch`) will be deprecated and produces worse performance so we did not use it. For PostgreSQL we implemented batch mode by doing a manual commit every x inserts and using COPY instead of INSERT. Another way to implement batch inserts is to use values lists (one insert statement with a list of values tuples) but this is not as fast as COPY. This mode can however be activated by passing `--extra-option use_values_lists=true`.

Azure Data Explorer offers compute and storage optimized sku types, as well as batch and stream ingestion. For storage optimized it was decided to test against Standard_L8s_v2, for compute optimized against Standard_E8a_v4 and in both cases a sku capacity of 2 was used.

### Insert performance

The table below shows the best results for the databases for a 3 node cluster and a resource limit of 8 cores and 10 GB memory per node. The exceptions are PostgreSQL, InfluxDB and TimescaleDB which were launched as only a single instance. Influx provides a clustered variant only with their Enterprise product and for TimescaleDB there is no official and automated way to create a cluster with a distributed hypertable. All tests were run with the newest available version of the databases at the time of testing and using the opensource or free versions.
Inserts were done with 16 parallel workers, and each test was run 3 times with the result being the average of these runs. For each run the inserts per second was calculated as the number of inserts divided by the sumed up duration of the workers.

<sup>*Inserts are not written into database immediately, but only queued</sup> 

You can find additional results from older runs in [old-results.md](old-results.md) but be aware that comparing them with the current ones is not always possible due to different conditions during the runs.

PostgreSQL can achieve very impressive speeds. Using single row inserts grouped into transactions we got about 44000 inserts/s. Using values lists we could increase that to about 215000 insert/s. But top speed was gained using the copy mode. Considering this is a single instance database without any specific database-side tuning that is really impressive and shows that PostgreSQL can still be the right choice for many usecases.

Earlier results for CockroachDB were way lower due to problems with `TransactionAbortedError(ABORT_REASON_NEW_LEASE_PREVENTS_TXN)` and potentially also optimizations in newer versions. The current test code implements a retry mechanism to compensate. Due to an incompatibility between CockroachDB and psycopg2 the copy mode could not be used. CockroachDB recommends using randomly-generated UUIDs in place of classical SERIAL primary keys, interestingly using the default SERIAL primary key shows better performance than using an UUID key (only about 57000 inserts/s). There seems to be no big difference between using a db-generated primary key and a client-generated one.

For Yugabyte using copy mode instead of values lists about doubles the insert speed. With the upgrade to version 2.15 speed for the YSQL interface increased by nearly an order of magnitude and became about equal to the speed of the YCQL interface.

ArangoDB achieves much of its speed by doing asynchronous writes as a normal insert will return before the document has been fsynced to disk. Enforcing that via `waitForSync` will massively slow down performance from 4500 insert/s to about 1500 for a 3 node cluster. For a single node instance it is even more pronounced with 7000 vs 1000 inserts/s. As long as ArangoDB is run in cluster mode enforcing sync should not be needed as replication ensures no data is lost if a single node goes down. So for our multi-node test we did not enforce sync.

For Cassandra we implemented two modes. One where after each insert the client waits for confirmation from the coordinator that the write was processed (called sync inserts in the table) and one where the clients sends several requests asynchronously. The limit of how many requests can be in-flight can be configured using the `max_sync_calls` parameter.
Although the results of our benchmarks show a drastic improvement, batching in most cases is not a recommended way to improve performance when using Cassandra. The current results are based on a singular device_id (and thus partition key) per worker. This results in all batched messages being processed as one write operation. With multiple devices per batch statement load on the coordinator node would increase and lead to performance and ultimately stability issues. (See [datastax docs on batching](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.3/cql/cql_using/useBatch.html)).

For TimescaleDB the insert performance depends a lot on the number and size of chunks that are written to. In a fill-level test with 50 million inserts per step where in each step the timestamps started again (so the same chunks were written to as in the last step) performance degraded rapidly. But in the more realistic case of ever increasing timestamps (so new chunks being added) performance stayed relatively constant.

Notable about Azure Data Explorer is the fact, that inserts are not immediately written to the database, instead their queued. The larger the batch/stream the longer it takes until the queue 
starts to work it off. Once started it can keep the pace. For example a couple of rows take 20 - 30 seconds to appear in the database, 1000 rows 5 - 6 minutes, but 12.5 million rows require also only 5 - 6 minutes.

The table gives the average query duration in seconds

This is a work-in-progress, not all databases have been tested and some queries are still being optimized.

Note: The `newest-per-device` query for YugabyteDB fails (`psycopg2.errors.ConfigurationLimitExceeded: temporary file size exceeds temp_file_limit (1048576kB)`) or gets aborted after about 30mins runtime. If the query is changed as described in [issue#7](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/database-performance-comparison/issues/7) to use a [Loose indexscan](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Loose_indexscan) it becomes very fast (`0.08s`). But as the other database systems have no problem with the original query this is not added to the comparison table. The good performance for the `temperature-stats` query is only achieved when `avg(temperature)` is replaced with `sum(temperature)/count(temperature)::numeric avg` as Yugabyte currently does not push down `avg` to the nodes for partial aggregation.

All queries were run several times against a database with 500 million rows preinserted. PostgreSQL and compatible databases had indices on the temperature and on the device_id and temperature columns provided. None of the databases were specifically tuned to optimize query execution. The queries were run 5 times and the given duration was the average over all runs (with the exception of Elasticsarch, see below for explanation). Note that the queries were run against otherwise idle databases, meaning we did not simulate a mixed load with inserts and queries at the same time.

Explanations for the queries:

* count-events: Get the number of events in the database (for SQL `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events`)
* temperature-min-max: Get the global minimum and maximum temperature over all devices. SQL databases can optimize here and use the index on temperature to speed up the query
* temperature-stats: The global minimum, average and maximum temperature over all devices
* temperature-stats-per-device: The minimum, average and maximum temperature per device
* newest-per-device: The newest temperature recorded per device

To see how the queries are formulated take a look at the `_queries` field in the `simulator/models/postgres.py` and `simulator/models/influxdb.py` files.

Both PostgeSQL and YugabyteDB take advantage of a provided index on temperature and are able to efficiently calculate the minimum and maximum temperature. CockroachDB seems to not have that optimization and needs a table scan to calculate the result.

When doing the query test against InfluxDB the service received an OOM kill with the insert configuration. To successfully complete the queries the service memory had to be increased to 100Gi.

For TimescaleDB query performance is also very dependent on the number and size of chunks. Too many or too few can negatively impact performance.

Elasticsearch seems to cache query results, as such running the queries several times will yield millisecond response times for all queries. The times noted in the table above are against a freshly started elasticsearch cluster.

In case of the newest-per-device query (compute optimized) Azure Data Explorer did not succeed but terminated with "partition operator exceed amount of maximum partitions allowed (64)."
When a query is run against Azure Data Explorer, the query engine tries to optimize it by breaking it down into smaller, parallelizable tasks that can be executed across multiple partitions. 
If the query requires more partitions than the maximum allowed limit, it will fail with the error message above.

For all databases there seems to be a rough linear correlation between query times and database size. So when running the tests with only 50 million rows the query times were about 10 times as fast.

## Running the tests

### Requirements

* A kubernetes cluster (tested with k3s 1.20.5 and minikube, any other should also work)
* Locally installed:
  * Python >= 3.8
  * kubectl
  * helm >= 3.4
  * Only tested on Linux, should also work on Mac, on Windows probably only with WSL

### Install database

You need a database to run the test against. To get you up and running quickly you can find below snippets to install databases using helm. Depending on what setup you want to test you need to edit the values files in `dbinstall/` to create a single or multi-node cluster. Depending on your cluster size and target workload you should also adapt the resource settings for each cluster.

Note: The provided values are for a k3s cluster. If you use another distribution or a cloud setup (e.g. EKS, AKS, GKE) please adapt them accordingly (at the minimum `storageClass`).

### Prepare the test

* Install the needed python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* If you use your own database installation or changed the provided ones edit `config.yaml`
  * Under `targets` edit the options for your database
  * if you want to use another kubernetes namespace than `default` set it there
* Make sure your local kubectl is configured and points to your cluster (Note: the `KUBECONFIG` environment override will currently not work correctly)

### Run the test

To run the test use `python run.py insert`. You can use the following options:

* `--target`: The target database to use (name must correspond to the target name in `config.yaml`). This is required
* `--workers`: Set of worker counts to try, default is `1,4,8,12,16` meaning the test will try with 1 concurrent worker, then with 4, then 8, then 12 and finally 16
* `--runs`: How often should the test be repeated for each worker count, default is `3`
* `--primary-key`: Defines how the primary key should be generated, see below for choices. Defaults to `db`
* `--tables`: To simulate how the databases behave if inserts are done to several tables. This option can be changed from `single` to `multiple` to have the test write into four instead of just one table
* `--num-inserts`: The number of inserts each worker should do, by default 10000 to get a quick result. Increase this to see how the databases behave under constant load. Also increase the timout option accordingly
* `--timeout`: How long should the script wait for the insert test to complete in seconds. Default is `0`. Increase accordingly if you increase the number of inserts or disable by setting to `0`
* `--batch`: Switch to batch mode (for postgres this means manual commits, for arangodb using the [batch api](https://docs.python-arango.com/en/main/batch.html)). Specify the number of inserts per transaction/batch
* `--extra-option`: Extra options to supply to the test scripts, can be used multiple times. Currently only used for ArangoDB (see below)
* `--clean` / `--no-clean`: By default the simulator will clean and recreate tables to always have the same basis for the runs. Can be disabled
* `--prefill`: Setting this to a positive number will insert that number of events into the database before starting the run
* `--steps`: Test performance with increasing database fill levels. Specifies the number of steps to do

If the test takes too long and the timeout is reached or the script runs into any problems it will crash. To clean up you must then manually uninstall the simulator by running `helm uninstall dbtest`.

The query test can be run using `python run.py query`. You can use the following options:

* `--target`: The target database to use (name must correspond to the target name in `config.yaml`). This is required
* `--workers`: Number of concurrent workers that should issue queries
* `--runs`: How often should each query be issued, default is `3`
* `--timeout`: How long should the script wait for the insert test to complete in seconds. Default is `0`. Increase accordingly if you increase the number of inserts or disable by stting to `0`

Before running the query test use the insert test to provide an appropriate amount of data.

### Primary key

There are several options on how the primary key for the database table can be generated, defined by the `--primary-key` option:

* `db`: The database generates a primary key using the SERIAL datatype for compatibility with old PostgreSQL versions
* `sql`: The database uses the standard `GENERATED ALWAYS ... AS IDENTITY` with a sequence cache size equal to the batch size for the primary key
* `client`: The workers supply a `varchar` primary key that is calculated based on the message content

Additionally you can change how the primary key is defined by setting the `primary_key_constraint` extra-option. By default the primary key is declared as `PRIMARY KEY (id)`. This option can replace it, for example to use the natural key `PRIMARY KEY (device_id, timestamp, sequence_number)` or even define the sharding like `PRIMARY KEY (device_id hash, timestamp asc, sequence_number asc)` for YugabyteDB.

### Prefill

By default the simulator will clean and recreate tables to always have the same basis for the runs. But in reality it is interesting to see how databases behave if they already have existing data. This can be accomplished in two ways:

* Manually prepare data and then tell the simulator to not clean up the existing data via `--no-clean`. You can also use this way to gradually fill up the database by not cleaning between runs.
* Use the `--prefill` option to have the simulator insert some data before doing the timed insert test. Independent of the chosen options the prefill will always happen in batch mode to be as fast as possible.

### Fill level performance

By default the simulator will test performance on an empty table. But it is also interesting to see how insert performance changes when the database already has existing data. To test that usecase you can use the `--steps <n>` option. The simulator will do the insert test `n` times without cleaning the tables between tests thereby testing the insert performance on existing data. The following constraints apply: The worker set can only contain one worker count and the run count must be `1`.

Example run with PostgreSQL:

```bash
python run.py --target postgresql -w 16 -r 1 --num-inserts 3125000 --batch 1000 --steps 10 --extra-option use_values_lists=true
Stepsize: 50000000
    Level Inserts/s
        0 182620
 50000000 181920
100000000 181150
150000000 181480
200000000 181920
250000000 182480
300000000 183660
350000000 181600
400000000 181200
450000000 182130
```

Each run will insert `num-inserts * workers` events (in this example 50 million) and the simulator will print a table with the number of existing events (fill level) and the insert performance for the next step.

Note that the results will have some spread depending on the environment and database. In normal tests this is compensated by doing several runs and averaging the results. For the fill level test this is not possible so treat the results accordingly.

## Database specifics

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is our baseline as the representitive of the classic SQL databases.

For the test we installed postgres using:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install postgres bitnami/postgresql -f dbinstall/postgresql-values.yaml
```

No other configuration / tuning was done.

### CockroachDB

CockroachDB is one of the representitives for distributed and scalable SQL databases with a postgres-compatible interface.

For the test we installed cockroachdb using:

```bash
helm repo add cockroachdb https://charts.cockroachdb.com/
helm install cockroachdb cockroachdb/cockroachdb -f dbinstall/cockroachdb-values.yaml --version 8.1.2
```

The values file as it is commited in git installs a 3 node cluster. To install a single node cluster change `statefulset.replicas` option and uncomment the `conf.single-node` option.

### YugabyteDB

YugabyteDB is one of the representitives for distributed and scalable SQL databases with a postgres-compatible interface.

For the test we installed yugabyteDB using:

```bash
helm repo add yugabytedb https://charts.yugabyte.com
helm install yugabyte yugabytedb/yugabyte -f dbinstall/yugabyte-values.yaml --version 2.15.1
```

The values file installs a 3 node cluster. To install a single node cluster change the `replicas` options. If you want more than 3 nodes you should set the `replicas.master` value to 3 and the `replicas.tserver` value to the node count you desire.

### ArangoDB

ArangoDB represents document databases without a fixed schema.

For the test we installed arangodb using:

```bash
export OPERATOR_VERSION=1.1.5
export URLPREFIX=https://github.com/arangodb/kube-arangodb/releases/download/${OPERATOR_VERSION}
helm install kube-arangodb $URLPREFIX/kube-arangodb-crd-${OPERATOR_VERSION}.tgz
helm install kube-arangodb-crd $URLPREFIX/kube-arangodb-${OPERATOR_VERSION}.tgz
kubectl apply -f dbinstall/arangodb-deployment.yaml
```

The values file installs a single node cluster. To install a 3 node cluster change `spec.mode` to `Cluster` and comment in the `spec.dbservers` options.

As a speciality for ArangoDB you can/must set extra options when running the test:

* `replication_factor`: By default this is set to `1`, to produce behaviour similar to the other databases in a cluster setting set this to `3`
* `shard_count`: By setting this option the collection will be created with the specified number of shards
* `sync`: By default the workers will not use the `waitForSync` option. Set this to `true` to force durable writes

### Cassandra

For Cassandra we rely on the k8ssandra project to install clusters on kubernetes.

```bash
helm repo add k8ssandra https://helm.k8ssandra.io/stable
helm install k8ssandra k8ssandra/k8ssandra -f dbinstall/k8ssandra-values.yaml
```

Note: In some tests we ran into timeouts during inserts. To compensate we edited the CassandraDatacenter resource after installation and added `write_request_timeout_in_ms: 10000` to the cassandra config.

For Cassandra the special parameter `max_sync_calls` can be specified. Setting it to `1` will have the client behave in a synchronous manner, waiting for the coordinator to confirm the insert before sending the next. Setting it to a value greater than one will have the client keep that many insert requests in flight and only blocking when the number is reached.

### InfluxDB

InfluxDB is a representitive of timeseries databases. We use the opensource version so test with only a single node.

For the test we installed InfluxDB using:

```bash
helm repo add influxdata https://helm.influxdata.com/
helm install influxdb influxdata/influxdb2 -f dbinstall/influxdb-values.yaml
```

The InfluxDB test module ignores the primary key and multiple table options.

### TimescaleDB

TimescaleDB is another representitive of timeseries databases, but this one is implemented on top of PostgreSQL.

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo add timescale https://charts.timescale.com/
# TimescaleDB requires SSL certificates, so use cert-manager to generate some
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --set installCRDs=true --wait
kubectl apply -f dbinstall/timescaledb-prerequisites.yaml
helm install timescaledb timescale/timescaledb-single -f dbinstall/timescaledb-values.yaml
```

### Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is very-well used for log and analytics data. From an abstract perspective it is a combination of document store and search engine.

```bash
helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co
helm install eck-operator elastic/eck-operator
kubectl apply -f dbinstall/elastic-deployment.yaml

```

### Azure Data Explorer

Azure Data Explorer (ADX) is a fully managed, high-performance, big data analytics platform. Azure Data Explorer can take all this varied data, and then ingest, process, and store it. You can use Azure Data Explorer for near real-time queries and advanced analytics.

To deploy an ADX-Cluster change the Service Principle (AAD) to your own Service Principle inside dbinstall/azure_data_explorer/main.tf:
```
data "azuread_service_principal" "service-principle" {
  display_name = "mw_iot_ADX-DB-Comparison"
}
```

Additionally adjust the following fields depending on your performance needs:

```
resource "azurerm_kusto_cluster" "adxcompare" {
  ...

  sku {
    name     = "Dev(No SLA)_Standard_E2a_v4"
    capacity = 1
  }
```

To apply the infrastructure, run:
```bash
az login
terraform apply
```

Finally, create the kubernetes secret:

````bash
kubectl create secret generic adx-secret  --from-literal=adx_aad_app_id=<your aad app id>  --from-literal=adx_app_key=<your app key>  --from-literal=adx_authority_id=<your authority id> -n default
````
To enable streaming set the `batch` parameter of the config to `false`. This will not apply to existing tables. 
Streaming ingestion on cluster level is enabled by default by terraform cluster config.


Besides having an emulator for ADX, capable of running locally, it is not recommended to use this emulator for any kind of benchmark tests, since the performance profile is very different. Furthermore, it is even prohibited by license terms.


## Remarks on the databases

This is a collection of problems / observations collected over the course of the tests.

* When inserting data CockroachDB sometimes errors out with `TransactionAbortedError(ABORT_REASON_NEW_LEASE_PREVENTS_TXN)`. The solution was to implement client-side retry.
* Yugabyte in YCQL mode sometimes ran into problems with `Read RPC timed out`.
* Cassandra had also problems with timeouts:
  * The 60 seconds timeout for batch inserts used in the client was sometimes not enough.
  * Some requests failed with the cassandra coordinator node running into timeouts while waiting for the replicas during inserts. Solution was to increase the write timeout in cassandra.

## Developing

This tool is split into two parts:

* A simulator that runs in kubernetes and does the work. It is split into a collector pod that initializes the database tables and collects the results and worker pods that run the workload (currently inserts).
* A cli that repeatedly launches the simulator with differnet arguments, collects the results and provides them to the user.

If you want to change the simulator you need to build your own docker image. The dockerfile for that is in the `simulator` folder. Afterwards change the `image.name` and `image.tag` parameters in the `deployment/values.yaml` file.
